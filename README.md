# Ruby-VM
This project is a 32-bit Virtual Machine (VM) implemented in Ruby. It emulates a simplified CPU with memory and registers, capable of executing a basic instruction set. Designed for educational purposes, it demonstrates low-level concepts like instruction decoding, memory addressing, and basic register operations.
